# Roadmap

### For later releases

- Generaliztion and enhancement of encode and decode functions

At this point we'll slap a Version 1.0.0 Full Release stamp on `jsoncons`
(we've been leading up to this since 2013.)

### Post 1.0.0

- Support more error recovery and introduce optional `lenient_error_handler`.

- Implement [Concise data definition language (CDDL)](https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-cbor-cddl-08) for schema validation in `jsoncons_ext`
